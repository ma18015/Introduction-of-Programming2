# Test Script for Introduction of Programming 2.

I didn't make some test script. \
This script is not used assert or that kind of thing. \
Just run with some inputs and print out ouputs, so you have to check the outputs with your own eyes. \
If you have any idea to solve this problem, plz let me know.

* template \
  Template for test script.
* show_program \
  Display program whose name is set by arg1.
* compile_test \
  Compile all program and check if compiling is passed.
