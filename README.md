# Test Script for Introduction of Programming 2.

I didn't make some test scripts. \
These scripts are not used assert or that kind of thing. \
Just run with some inputs and print ouputs, so you have to check the outputs with your own eyes. \
If you have any idea to solve this problem(especially how to deal with `printf`), plz let me know.

Defalt src path is `./src`, so plz put c files in src dir. \
Optionally, you can set your path to src by arg1 for all files below except for show\_program. \
Only for show\_program you can set path by arg2.
* test script \
  Run c file with some input cases and print outputs.
* template \
  Template for test script.
* show_program \
  Display program whose name is set by arg1.
* compile_test \
  Compile all program and check if compiling is passed.
* download.sh \
  To download your group src you just run this script like \
  `gnum=your_group_number pass=your_password id=your_student_id ./download.sh`
